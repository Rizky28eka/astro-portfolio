### üìå Project Overview

This AI-based Medical Diagnosis Application is a student project developed at Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta. It leverages Machine Learning (ML) models to predict diseases based on user input data and provides informative data visualizations.

### üíæ Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- Preprocessed medical datasets
- Google Colab Notebooks for model training
- Trained model files (.pkl) for disease prediction:
  - Breast Cancer
  - Diabetes
  - Fetal Health
  - Heart Disease
  - Kidney Disease
  - Lung Cancer
- Streamlit web application code

### üöÄ Key Features

- üè• AI-based disease prediction using Machine Learning models
- üìä Interactive Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- üåê User-friendly Web Interface built with Streamlit
- üîç Secure Data Handling using Pandas
- üì± Responsive design accessible from various devices

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python üêç** - Primary programming language
- **Streamlit üé®** - Framework for building web apps
- **Scikit-Learn ü§ñ** - Machine Learning library
- **Pandas & NumPy üìä** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn üìà** - Data visualization libraries
- **Pickle üíæ** - For saving and loading trained models

### üìã System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- At least 1GB of storage space

### üìå How to Run the Application Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0073212/AI_Medical_Diagnosis_App.git
cd AI_Medical_Diagnosis_App
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash

# Create virtual environment

python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment

# On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
