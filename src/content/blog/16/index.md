# Git Workflow and Best Practices for Modern Development

Git has become the standard version control system for modern software development. This guide explores essential Git workflows, branching strategies, and best practices for efficient collaboration.

## Git Workflow Strategies

### 1. Git Flow

```bash
# Main branches
main        # Production branch
develop     # Development branch

# Supporting branches
feature/*   # New features
release/*   # Release preparation
hotfix/*    # Production fixes
```

### 2. GitHub Flow

```bash
# Simple workflow
main        # Production branch
feature/*   # Feature branches
```

## Essential Git Commands

### Basic Operations

```bash
# Initialize repository
git init

# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Create and switch branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push changes
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Advanced Operations

```bash
# Stash changes
git stash save "work in progress"

# Apply stashed changes
git stash pop

# Rebase branch
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

## Branching Strategies

### Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Create pull request
# Merge after review
```

### Release Branch Workflow

```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

# Make release-specific changes
git commit -m "chore: prepare release 1.0.0"

# Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge release/1.0.0
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.0.0
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```bash
# Format
<type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples
feat(auth): add user authentication
fix(api): resolve login timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation guide
```

### 2. Branch Naming

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes
fix/login-error
fix/api-timeout

# Hotfixes
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/critical-bug
```

### 3. Code Review Process

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push to remote
4. Create pull request
5. Address review comments
6. Merge after approval

## Advanced Git Features

### 1. Git Hooks

```bash
# pre-commit hook
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint
npm run test

# pre-push hook
#!/bin/sh
npm run build
```

### 2. Git Aliases

```bash
# Add to .gitconfig
[alias]
    st = status
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    unstage = reset HEAD --
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. SSH Keys

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 2. Git Ignore

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/

# Build output
dist/
build/

# Environment files
.env
.env.local

# IDE files
.idea/
.vscode/
```

## Collaboration Tips

### 1. Pull Request Template

```markdown
## Description

[Describe your changes]

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated

## Screenshots

[If applicable]
```

### 2. Code Review Checklist

- Code follows style guide
- Tests are included
- Documentation is updated
- No security vulnerabilities
- Performance is considered

## Conclusion

Effective Git usage requires:

- Understanding of workflows
- Consistent practices
- Good communication
- Regular backups
- Security awareness

Remember to:

- Write clear commit messages
- Review code thoroughly
- Keep branches up to date
- Use appropriate tools
- Follow team conventions

Happy Git development!
