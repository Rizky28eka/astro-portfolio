## 🚀 Getting Started with Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It allows developers to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop — all from a single codebase.

---

## 🌟 Why Flutter?

- 🧠 Single Codebase: Write once, run on both Android & iOS.
- 🎨 Beautiful UI: Comes with a rich set of widgets that follow Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-style) standards.
- ⚡ Fast Development: Hot Reload lets you see changes instantly without restarting the app.
- 🔧 Native Performance: Compiles to native ARM code, so apps are super smooth.

## 🛠️ Basic Setup

1. Install Flutter SDK: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Set up an editor: VS Code or Android Studio recommended.
3. Run flutter doctor:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

## 📱 Hello World Example

Here's a simple app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hello Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Welcome')),
        body: const Center(child: Text('Hello, world!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
