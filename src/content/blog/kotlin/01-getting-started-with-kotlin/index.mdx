## Getting Started with Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern programming language that makes Android development faster and more enjoyable. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up Kotlin in Android Studio and writing your first Kotlin program.

## Why Choose Kotlin?

Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development because it:

- Reduces boilerplate code
- Prevents common programming errors
- Is fully interoperable with Java
- Has excellent tooling support
- Is officially supported by Google

## Setting Up Kotlin in Android Studio

1. Download and install Android Studio from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Launch Android Studio
3. Create a new project:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Empty Activity"
   - Name your project
   - Choose "Kotlin" as the language
   - Select minimum SDK version
   - Click "Finish"

## Your First Kotlin Program

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

## Basic Kotlin Syntax

Let's look at some fundamental Kotlin concepts:

### Variables

```kotlin
// Immutable variable (like final in Java)
val name = "John"

// Mutable variable
var age = 25
```

### Functions

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String): String {
    return "Hello, $name!"
}

// Single-expression function
fun square(x: Int) = x * x
```

### String Templates

```kotlin
val name = "Alice"
println("Hello, $name!")  // Simple variable
println("Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}!")  // Expression
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Kotlin set up, you can:

1. Explore more Kotlin features
2. Build your first Android app
3. Learn about Kotlin's null safety features
4. Study Kotlin's object-oriented programming concepts
