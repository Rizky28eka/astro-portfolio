## Collaborate Using Feature Branches

Feature branches are a powerful way to collaborate on projects. This guide will show you how to effectively use feature branches for team collaboration.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating feature branches
- Managing branches
- Collaboration workflow
- Best practices
- Common scenarios

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   # Create and switch to branch
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature

   # Push branch to remote
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature

   # Verify branch
   git branch -v
   ```

   - Create branch
   - Set upstream
   - Verify setup
   - Start working

2. **Branch Management**

   ```bash
   # Update main branch
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Update feature branch
   git checkout feature/new-feature
   git rebase main

   # Push changes
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

   - Keep updated
   - Handle conflicts
   - Push changes
   - Monitor status

3. **Collaboration**

   ```bash
   # Allow collaboration
   git push origin feature/new-feature

   # Pull changes
   git pull origin feature/new-feature

   # Review changes
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```

   - Share branch
   - Pull updates
   - Review changes
   - Coordinate work

4. **Merge Process**

   ```bash
   # Update main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Merge feature
   git merge feature/new-feature

   # Push changes
   git push origin main
   ```

   - Prepare merge
   - Handle conflicts
   - Complete merge
   - Clean up

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Naming**

   - Use prefixes
   - Be descriptive
   - Follow convention
   - Keep it short

2. **Branch Management**

   - Regular updates
   - Clean history
   - Delete merged
   - Monitor status

3. **Collaboration**

   - Clear communication
   - Regular sync
   - Code review
   - Documentation

4. **Workflow**

   - Follow process
   - Use templates
   - Track progress
   - Maintain quality

## Common Use Cases

1. **New Feature**

   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/user-auth

   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add user authentication"

   # Push changes
   git push origin feature/user-auth
   ```

2. **Bug Fix**

   ```bash
   # Create fix branch
   git checkout -b fix/login-issue

   # Fix bug
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix login issue"

   # Push fix
   git push origin fix/login-issue
   ```

3. **Code Review**

   ```bash
   # Update branch
   git checkout feature/new-feature
   git pull origin main

   # Push for review
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

4. **Team Collaboration**

   ```bash
   # Share branch
   git push origin feature/team-feature

   # Pull updates
   git pull origin feature/team-feature
   ```

## Advanced Usage

1. **Branch Protection**

   ```bash
   # Set up protection
   git config branch.feature/new-feature.protect true

   # Require reviews
   git config branch.feature/new-feature.requireReview true
   ```

2. **Automated Testing**

   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test

   # Check coverage
   npm run coverage

   # Verify quality
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Continuous Integration**

   ```bash
   # Set up CI
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml
   name: CI
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - run: npm test
   ```

4. **Code Review**

   ```bash
   # Create PR
   gh pr create --title "New Feature" --body "Description"

   # Review PR
   gh pr review 123 --approve
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Merge Conflicts**

   ```bash
   # Resolve conflicts
   git checkout feature/new-feature
   git rebase main
   # ... resolve conflicts ...
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   ```

2. **Branch Updates**

   ```bash
   # Update branch
   git checkout feature/new-feature
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

3. **Remote Changes**

   ```bash
   # Pull changes
   git pull origin feature/new-feature

   # Handle conflicts
   git mergetool
   ```
