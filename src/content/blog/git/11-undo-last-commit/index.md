## Undo Last Commit Safely

Sometimes you need to undo your last commit without losing your changes. This guide will show you different ways to undo commits safely while maintaining a clean Git history.

## What You'll Learn

- How to undo the last commit while keeping changes
- How to completely remove the last commit
- How to revert a commit that's already pushed
- Best practices for undoing commits
- When to use different undo strategies

## Implementation Steps

1. **Undo Last Commit (Keep Changes)**

   ```bash
   # Undo last commit but keep changes staged
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```

   - Removes the commit but keeps all changes staged
   - Perfect for fixing commit messages or adding forgotten files
   - Safe for local commits

2. **Undo Last Commit (Unstage Changes)**

   ```bash
   # Undo last commit and unstage changes
   git reset HEAD~1
   ```

   - Removes the commit and unstages changes
   - Changes remain in your working directory
   - Good for when you want to review changes before committing

3. **Completely Remove Last Commit**

   ```bash
   # Remove last commit and all changes
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

   - Completely removes the commit and all changes
   - Use with caution as changes cannot be recovered
   - Only for local commits

4. **Revert a Pushed Commit**

   ```bash
   # Create a new commit that undoes changes
   git revert HEAD
   ```

   - Creates a new commit that undoes the changes
   - Safe for shared/pushed commits
   - Maintains history for other team members

## Best Practices

1. **Before Undoing Commits**

   - Check if the commit has been pushed
   - Review the commit you want to undo
   - Make sure you have a clean working directory
   - Consider creating a backup branch

2. **Choosing the Right Method**

   - Use `--soft` when you want to keep changes staged
   - Use `--mixed` (default) when you want to review changes
   - Use `--hard` only for local commits you're sure you want to remove
   - Use `revert` for shared commits

3. **Working with Remote Repositories**

   - Never force push after resetting shared commits
   - Use revert for commits that others might have pulled
   - Communicate with your team before undoing shared commits

4. **Recovery Strategies**

   - Keep the commit hash before undoing
   - Use `git reflog` to find lost commits
   - Create backup branches for important changes

## Common Use Cases

1. **Fixing Commit Messages**

   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   git commit -m "New commit message"
   ```

2. **Adding Forgotten Files**

   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   git add forgotten-file.txt
   git commit -m "Add forgotten file"
   ```

3. **Undoing a Pushed Commit**

   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

4. **Splitting a Commit**

   ```bash
   git reset HEAD~1
   git add file1.txt
   git commit -m "First part of changes"
   git add file2.txt
   git commit -m "Second part of changes"
   ```

## Advanced Usage

1. **Undoing Multiple Commits**

   ```bash
   # Undo last 3 commits
   git reset --soft HEAD~3
   ```

2. **Interactive Rebase for Complex Undos**

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

3. **Recovering Lost Commits**

   ```bash
   git reflog
   git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
   ```

4. **Partial Revert**

   ```bash
   git revert -n HEAD
   git reset
   git add specific-files
   git commit -m "Partial revert"
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Accidental Hard Reset**

   ```bash
   # Find the lost commit
   git reflog
   # Restore it
   git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
   ```

2. **Merge Commit Revert**

   ```bash
   git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
   ```

3. **Conflicts During Revert**

   ```bash
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add resolved-files
   git revert --continue
   ```

## Conclusion

Knowing how to undo commits safely is crucial for maintaining a clean Git history. Remember to:

- Choose the right method based on your needs
- Be careful with shared commits
- Keep backups of important changes
- Communicate with your team
- Use the appropriate reset or revert strategy
