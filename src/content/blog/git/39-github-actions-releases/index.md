## Automate Releases with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides powerful automation capabilities for managing releases. This guide shows you how to set up automated releases for your projects.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up GitHub Actions
- Creating release workflows
- Version management
- Release automation
- Best practices

## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Setup**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/release.yml
   name: Release
   on:
     push:
       tags:
         - "v*"

   jobs:
     release:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Create Release
           uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
           with:
             files: |
               dist/*.zip
               dist/*.tar.gz
   ```

   - Create workflow file
   - Configure triggers
   - Set up jobs
   - Define steps

2. **Version Management**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/version.yml
   name: Version
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     version:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Bump version
           uses: phips28/gh-action-bump-version@master
           with:
             commitMessage: "chore: bump version to {{version}}"
   ```

   - Configure versioning
   - Set up bumping
   - Handle commits
   - Manage tags

3. **Release Process**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/release-process.yml
   name: Release Process
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Build
           run: npm run build
         - name: Upload artifacts
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
           with:
             name: dist
             path: dist/
   ```

   - Build process
   - Artifact handling
   - Release creation
   - Distribution

4. **Automation Rules**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/automation.yml
   name: Automation
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [labeled]

   jobs:
     automate:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Check label
           if: github.event.label.name == 'release'
           run: |
             echo "Release label detected"
   ```

   - Define triggers
   - Set conditions
   - Handle events
   - Manage workflow
