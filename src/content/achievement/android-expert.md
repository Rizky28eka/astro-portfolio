### Advanced Topics Covered

Some of the key materials focused on in this program include:

- **Application Architecture:** Implementing modern architectural patterns like Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) to separate business logic from the UI, resulting in cleaner and more structured code.
- **Reactive Programming:** Utilizing Kotlin Coroutines and Flow to handle asynchronous operations efficiently and declaratively, especially for tasks like API calls and database access.
- **Dependency Injection:** Using Hilt to manage dependencies automatically, simplifying the testing process and improving application modularity.
- **Database Management:** Using the Room Persistence Library to create an abstraction layer over SQLite, facilitating complex database operations and ensuring type safety.
- **Advanced Networking:** Implementing a robust networking layer using Retrofit and OkHttp, including how to handle errors, interceptors, and caching.
- **Modularization:** Breaking down the application into several independent modules to speed up build times, increase code reusability, and facilitate team collaboration.
- **Testing:** Writing unit tests and instrumentation tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

By completing this program, I gained the ability to design and build complex Android applications in accordance with industry standards and best practices.
