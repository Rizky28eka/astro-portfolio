More than just building models, this class teaches the software engineering aspects behind machine learning systems (MLOps). This program from Dicoding Academy focuses on best practices for taking models from the experimentation stage to the production stage, where they can provide real, continuous value.

### ML System Engineering Aspects Covered

Some of the key components in building a solid machine learning system include:

- **ML System Design Principles:** Understanding the unique considerations in designing ML-based systems, such as scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
- **Data Engineering Pipeline:** Building workflows for automated data collection, processing, and validation to ensure that the data fed into the model is always of high quality.
- **Model Deployment Strategies:** Learning various methods for deploying models to a production environment, such as batch prediction, online prediction (via API), and edge deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implementing systems to continuously monitor model performance in a production environment, detect model drift or performance degradation, and log predictions for further analysis.
- **Versioning:** Implementing versioning strategies not only for code but also for data and models, to ensure reproducibility and the ease of rolling back to previous versions if problems arise.
- **Automation (CI/CD for ML):** Building Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that automatically test, train, and redeploy models when new data or code changes are introduced.

With the knowledge from this class, I can design efficient and reliable ML system architectures, as well as manage the model lifecycle in a production environment.
