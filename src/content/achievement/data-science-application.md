### Project Stages Covered

The learning process covers the entire data science project lifecycle:

- **Problem Scoping:** Understanding the business problem and translating it into a measurable and answerable data science question.
- **Data Collection & Preparation:** Gathering data from various sources and performing cleaning, transformation, and handling of missing values to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing exploratory data analysis to find patterns, anomalies, and initial insights using statistical techniques and data visualization with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models.
- **Modeling:** Building predictive models using various machine learning algorithms from the Scikit-learn library, such as Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) and techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.

By completing this class, I am able to manage a simple data science project from start to finish, as well as communicate the results effectively.
