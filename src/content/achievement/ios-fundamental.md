### Basic Concepts Covered

Some of the main pillars of this learning include:

- **Introduction to Xcode:** Dissecting Apple's official Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Xcode. This includes how to manage projects, use the Interface Builder, and run applications on the simulator or physical devices.
- **Swift Programming Language:** Learning the syntax, data types, control flow, and the protocol-oriented programming paradigm that is characteristic of Swift.
- **Building User Interfaces (UI):** Designing UIs visually using Storyboards and Auto Layout to ensure an adaptive display on various iPhone and iPad screen sizes.
- **View Controller Lifecycle:** Understanding the lifecycle of a View Controller, the central point of every screen in an iOS application, to properly manage state and events.
- **App Navigation:** Implementing navigation flows between screens using components like Navigation Controllers and Tab Bar Controllers.
- **Displaying Data:** Using `UITableView` to efficiently display lists of data, a very common pattern found in many applications.

By completing this class, I have a strong foundation for designing and developing functional and intuitive iOS applications.
