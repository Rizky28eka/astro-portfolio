### Key Skills Acquired

- **Understanding LLM Fundamentals:** Gaining insight into how LLMs work, including their capabilities and limitations, to better inform prompt design.
- **Prompting Techniques:** Learning various methods such as zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, as well as chain-of-thought and other advanced strategies.
- **Contextual Prompting:** Mastering the ability to provide clear and sufficient context to guide the model toward the desired output, whether for code generation, debugging, or documentation.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Developing a process for testing and refining prompts to systematically improve the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the model's response.
- **Use Cases in Development:** Applying prompt engineering to practical software development scenarios, including generating boilerplate code, explaining complex code snippets, writing unit tests, and creating documentation.

Completing this course has equipped me with the skills to leverage AI as a powerful assistant in the software development lifecycle, increasing productivity and improving code quality.
